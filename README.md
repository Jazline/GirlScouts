# Girl scout troop
A blogging/sharing site for a girl scout troop.  Requirements:

Example of a terrible site with some basic functions:
https://gstroop1690.shutterfly.com/


Minimum viable product:
1) user/logins to get in
2) Some nice photos of the troop.  This can just be 3-4 photos manually served for MVP.
3) Some "news" from the leaders (upcoming events, announcements etc).  This can be manually written for MVP.
4) A calendar showing upcoming events.  Either a Box or a list of events.  This should be created from the calendar database items.
5) A simple Blogging feature where users can enter new comments, and other users can respond to those items.  This is very similar to the blogging assignments from class.
6) A nice looking site with some branding borrowed from Girl scouts of america or some other example.

Nice to have features:
1) photo sharing.  uploading, downloading, browsing
2) better calendar.  3rd party integration?  Best experience would be Google calendar just integrated so that members could sync to the troop calendar.
3) admin page.  See incoming membership requests, manage membership list, etc.
4) Sign up sheets.  A common need is a list of people signing up for cookie booths, camping trips etc.  So a table made from a SQL table that shows who is going etc.  
5) generic file sharing.


1) user/logins to get in
2) photo sharing.  uploading, downloading, browsing
3) calendar sharing.  Needs to show a calendar on the main site, as well as being able to focus on just calendar work.  nice if it can be optionall synced to google calendar and/or outlook.
4) blogging/messaging.  A running blog of announcements and comms.  Admins can send out emails?  need a way of keeping email lists.
5) admin portal:  see requested signups, manage users, maillists, etc.  rosters.  who has permission to modify the calendar, whatever.  So much easier if it could be sharepoint...  actually... it has to be login based anyway...
6) file browser.  folder based file sharing.
7) sign up sheets.  These are tables.
